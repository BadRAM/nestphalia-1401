Campaign Plan
=============
Your origins: TBD
The world:
Four bug kingdoms, Blue, Yellow, Green, and Red, arranged like
 R
Y G
 B
Red: Ant kingdom. Hard forts that use everything in the game. Final Boss: Frog, the pretender king
Yellow: Bee kingdom, expect many flyers. rewards are strong against ground. Final Boss: Queen bee, the self important
Green: Beetle kingdom, rewards are strong against air. Final Boss: Hercules, the hero of legend
Blue: Bug republic (Hansneatic league?), assorted shitter bugs, rewards are basic kit. Final Boss: Snederick of Snaxony, Leader-Elect of the autonomous bug republic (big snail)
You start in the bottom corner of blue. Forts have paths to neighboring forts that you unlock for defeating them, but paths out of a country don't work until you defeat the capitol, so you must defeat either Y or G before you can attack R, and cannot attack either before clearing B.
